          HellFire Rising is my first attempt at writing a vb game using directx.
          I wanted to make a game similar in some aspects to the old game Raptor.
          In it's most basic sense it is in many ways a lot like VBSpaceShooter
          which I wrote a couple of years ago, but with better graphics, full screen
          display, and a much cleaner/crisper look.  It also includes an area to buy and
          sell parts for your ship to upgrade it's abilities.  In game menus and options
          make this game in many ways like an older retail game.  I wrote this game
          for a lot of reasons, some listed below:
          <ul>
            <li>Prove to a friend you can make a pretty cool game in vb and he now
                agrees.
            <li>Make a game that can be entertaining to play.
            <li>Write a game that some of the other vb developers can hopefully
                learn a little from.
            <li>Pass some of my free time
          </ul>

          <B>Why make it a sourceforge page?</b><BR><BR>
          </font>
          The biggest reason I did this is because I think this game has some
          potential to be pretty cool and go even beyond where it's at now.  So
          I setup a sourceforge account where others can access updates, and
          make suggestions to me and maybe even get a person or two to help with it.
