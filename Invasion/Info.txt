Invasion is the original name of a game I started working on as a little pet project over
a year ago.  It's been very on again off again work but over this year it's progressed a lot.
It's new name is HellFire Rising as suggested by a friend.  This is a fairly complete game,
which has even undergone a certain degree of debugging.  In many ways it's a bit like the
old game raptor, which I'm sure many of you have played.  You start out with a standard ship,
then you progress through ever increasingly difficult levels, buying new weapons and upgrades
for your ship.  Each enemy you kill gets you a certain amount of money, each level gets you
a certain ammount of money, and picking up the green money signs gets you money.

Now I'm going to be completly honest regarding the coding.  It's a bit sloppy.  I tried to 
stick to a variable naming scheme but I know in some places they are wrong.  This more than
anything is due to the length of time working on it, with at many times long breaks in between.
The end result a lot of times I couldn't remember exactly what I was doing last time I worked
on it.  But as it is I think that if your at this level of vb programming you shouldn't have
to much trouble with the code, and you may even find the game enjoyable.

Anyway leave feedback regarding the code/game. Knowing others opinions and ideas is the best
way to improve upon something.
